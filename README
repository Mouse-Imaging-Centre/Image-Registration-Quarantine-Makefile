Script based on Vladimir Fonov's minc tools builder script, that in addition
to the minc tools, also installs software neccessary to run the Mouse Imaging
Centre (MICe) registration software

MAIN WEBSITE:
https://wiki.phenogenomics.ca/display/MICePub/Building+a+registration+quarantine

PURPOSE: Build ALL or a subset of the MNI-BIC tools and MICe registration
software

DETAILS:
This script is supposed to download one or more packages, and the build em.
Now since one may not always want to compile the kitchen sink, Vlad has
conveniently provided an assortment of tagets which will permit you to
build various subsets of the totality. Here are some options:

(a) make minc-full
-> this makes a bunch of stuff (but not ALL, ... not really)
-> for those of you who don't like reading Makefiles, "minc-full"
includes: netcdf, hdf5, minc,
bicpl, N3, conglomerate, glim_image, mni_autoreg,
mincblob, mni_perllib, ray_trace, mincbet

(b) make minc-only
-> just makes minc and dependencies (netcdf, hdf5)

(c) make minc-with-itk
-> just like it sounds: minc + itk + ezminc

(d) make visual
-> make the visualization programs: register + Display + postf
-> I suspect that these have been segregated from the "all" build
since these programs are trickier to build ... i.e. more
dependencies, therefore more to go wrong.

(e) make full-MICe-quarantine
-> makes basically all. There are still a couple of packages that need to be
installed seperately. For more information see:
https://wiki.phenogenomics.ca/display/MICePub/Building+a+registration+quarantine


EXAMPLES:

[A] >> make minc-only INSTALL_DIR=`realpath install_dir` BUILD_DIR=`realpath build_dir`

Notes --
(1) we are building a relatively small install comprising minc (and dependencies) only
(2) INSTALL_DIR = the directory root to which you expect the built packages
to be installed. For example, this could be "/usr/local/bic" ... but if
it is, you had better be running as root. Default is the current dir.
(3) we use the "realpath" program to expand out my local dir (eg. "install_dir")
into a full absolute path name. It would appear as if this Makefile does not
like relative paths. If on Debian/Ubuntu, type "sudo apt-get realpath".
(4) BUILD_DIR is a temporary build directory. Feel free to wipe it out when
the build is complete. Default is the current dir.


[B] >>make minc-with-itk INSTALL_DIR=`realpath install_dir` BUILD_DIR=`realpath build_dir`

Notes --
(1) the same as above, but add ezminc, itk, and their dependencies


[C] >>make minc-full INSTALL_DIR=`realpath install_dir` BUILD_DIR=`realpath build_dir` PARALLEL_BUILD=-j2
>>make visual INSTALL_DIR=`realpath install_dir` BUILD_DIR=`realpath build_dir`
>>make models INSTALL_DIR=`realpath install_dir` BUILD_DIR=`realpath build_dir`

Notes --
(1) make all ... and use up to 2 cores
(2) make register, Display and postf (needs the previous make to finish first)
NB: currently (20May2011) Display needs to have its final link line corrected in order
to produce an executable
(3) install a whack of MNI-BIC models for use with mritotal, etc.


DEPENDENCIES:


For the most up-to-date dependencies, please refer to the website:
https://wiki.phenogenomics.ca/display/MICePub/Building+a+registration+quarantine


Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 LTS
(i) You do not want nor need netcdf or hdf5 from the repos, as we build
these from source. If these are around, get rid of them if you can,
else linking could end of grabbing the wrong version
(ii) apt-get the following before you start:
-> build-essential (for compilers, make, etc)
-> realpath (see above)
-> zlib1g-dev (minc)
-> bison (minc)
-> flex (minc)
-> libx11-dev (ray-trace)
-> glutg3-dev (ray-trace)
-> libxmu-dev, libxi-dev (ray-trace)

sudo apt-get install build-essential realpath \
zlib1g-dev bison flex \
libx11-dev glutg3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev


Ubuntu 11.04

sudo apt-get install build-essential realpath \
zlib1g-dev bison flex \
libx11-dev glutg3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev \
automake libtool
